I am an M.Phil. student in Risk Management Science in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk) at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). I am doing research under the supervision of [Prof. Kin Wai CHAN](https://sites.google.com/site/kwchankeith/home?authuser=0). My research interests include time series, nonparametric inference, Bayesian methods and econometrics.
